# DynaMoDe-NeRF
This repository contains the dataset used in paper DynaMoDe-NeRF (CVPR -2025)
## Dataset Description
1. Contains four synthetic dynamic videos: These datasets are synthesized in Blender. Additionally, we modified the static dataset proposed in Deblur-NeRF by incorporating a dynamic object.
2. We also provide real videos captured from multiple fixed static cameras. The videos are syncronized based on sound, laser light and the visual information.
